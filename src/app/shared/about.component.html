              <p>For engineers and programmers, the recruiting industry is like the Wild, Wild, West.
              Every single day we are bombarded with emails, phone calls, and LinkedIn requests about
              full-time positions from total strangers.</p>

              <p>Most of these job offers are a hodgepodge of technical buzzwords designed for search engines and job boards.
              Every recruiters wants your time, resume, and personal information.</p>

              <p>Most times you never hear from them again.</p>

              <p>There is no rating system on how professional, effective, or ethical these recruiters are.</p>

              <p>Our goal is to help you find quality recruiters and give reviews on the ones that don't meet standards.ï»¿</p>
